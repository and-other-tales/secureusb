_Last updated: 2025-01-01_

This Commercial End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single legal entity) ("Licensee") and PI & Other Tales, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 8 The Green, Dover, Delaware 19901 United States ("Licensor"), covering the commercial use of the SecureUSB software, accompanying media, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation (collectively, the "Software"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software for commercial purposes, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not agree, do not install or use the Software commercially.

## 1. Relationship to Open-Source License

SecureUSB is available under the MIT License for open-source and non-commercial use. This Agreement governs any commercial evaluation, deployment, or distribution of the Software. Licensee must obtain the Software under either the MIT License or this Agreement, but not both simultaneously.

## 2. Grant of License

Subject to Licensee's compliance with this Agreement and payment of applicable fees, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Software internally in connection with Licensee's business operations.

## 3. Permitted Use

- Deploy the Software on Licensee-owned or controlled hardware solely for Licensee's internal business purposes.
- Modify the Software as necessary for internal use, provided that modified versions are not distributed to third parties.
- Create reasonable backups of the Software for archival purposes.

## 4. Restrictions

Licensee shall not:

- Sublicense, sell, lease, or otherwise distribute the Software or derivative works to any third party without express written permission from Licensor.
- Remove or obscure any proprietary notices contained in the Software.
- Use the Software to provide hosted, managed, or service-bureau offerings to third parties without a separate written agreement.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except as expressly permitted by applicable law.

## 5. Fees and Verification

Commercial rights are conditioned on timely payment of all applicable fees. Licensor may request reasonable documentation to verify compliance with the scope of the license. Licensee shall cooperate with any such verification that does not unreasonably interfere with business operations.

## 6. Support and Updates

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, this Agreement does not entitle Licensee to technical support, maintenance, or updates. Any support or update services must be purchased separately and will be subject to additional terms.

## 7. Intellectual Property

The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to Licensee except as expressly set forth herein.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT LICENSEE'S OWN RISK.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 10. Termination

Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately if Licensee fails to comply with any term. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all commercial use of the Software and destroy all copies in its possession. Sections that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including Sections 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

## 11. General

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Licensor is organized, without regard to conflict of law principles. The parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction. Licensee may not assign this Agreement without Licensor's prior written consent. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties.
